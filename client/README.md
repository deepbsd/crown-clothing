This app uses Firebase to store user data and shopping collection data, also to provide user 
authentication and credit card clearance. Currently there are about twenty fictitious items
for sale, but the shopping cart works, and the checkout works.  Users can create an account, sign in
and sign out, and when they pay they must use the provided credentials for a fictitious credit
cart on the check out page.

You don't have to create an account, but you can if you want.  You can add items to your cart 
if you just want to practice or test out the shopping and checkout process.
